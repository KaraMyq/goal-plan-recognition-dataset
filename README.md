# Goal and Plan Recognition Dataset

This repository contains datasets for goal and plan recognition as planning.

We created these datasets to evaluate goal/plan recognition approaches that use planning techniques.

We added 15 datasets with missing and full observations, and 4 datasets with missing and noisy observations.

- Six of these datasets were created by Ram√≠rez and Geffner, and they are available in: https://sites.google.com/site/prasplanning/. Based on these six datasets, which contain hundreds of goal/plan recognition problems, we added larger planning problems and generated new datasets from the remaining 9 planning domains;
- The datasets with missing and noisy observations were generated based on the code provided by Sohrabi in https://github.com/shirin888/planrecogasplanning-ijcai16-benchmarks;

These datasets were used in the experiments described in [Landmark-Based Heuristics for Goal Recognition](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI17/paper/view/14666).
