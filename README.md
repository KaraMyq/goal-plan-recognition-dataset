# Goal and Plan Recognition Dataset

This repository contains datasets for goal and plan recognition as planning.

We created these datasets to evaluate goal/plan recognition approaches that use planning techniques.

We added 15 datasets with missing and full observations, and 4 datasets with missing and noisy observations.

These datasets were used in the experiments described in [Landmark-Based Heuristics for Goal Recognition](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI17/paper/view/14666).
